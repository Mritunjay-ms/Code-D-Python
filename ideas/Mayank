1st- We will issue a unique Alumni ID to every graduating student, which will serve as a lifelong identifier linking them to our institution. This ID will be used to maintain accurate and updated records of each alumnus, including their contact details, academic achievements, career progress, and participation in alumni activities.
2nd- College students can request funds from alumni to support events such as fests and other events.
Future Scope- Students can seek mentorship and career guidance from alumni to gain industry insights and professional advice.
