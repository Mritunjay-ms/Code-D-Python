1.Contact system
Making available social media account of alumni to the junior/user so they can easily contact them.
Future scope:
In future we can integrate a built-in chat system so that juniors/user can directly contact alumni without going to different platforms.

2.Automated messaging
If an institution is organising an event in a city then a automated message is sent to all of the alumnis which are resinding in the same city.
Future scope:
Instead of manual updating city we use an automatic system that keeps track of current city of an alumni.
