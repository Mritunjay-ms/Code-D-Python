I have an Idea.

# Alumni Status Section – Idea Overview

=> Concept:-
The Alumni Status is a dedicated profile/section that showcases an alumnus’ contributions, achievements, and involvement with their alma mater.
It acts as a digital badge of credibility, highlighting how alumni are engaged in giving back — through donations, mentorship, internships, collaborations, and event participation.

=> Key Components of Alumni Status:-
1. Financial & Event Contributions
      -Records donations given by the alumnus (festival funding, seminars, workshops, scholarships, etc.).
      -Displays events/workshops the alumnus sponsored or participated in.
      -Transparency: Amount donated can be shown publicly (if alumnus opts-in) or just listed as “sponsor.”

2. Mentorship & Internships
       -Number of juniors mentored by this alumnus.
       -Internships/jobs offered through their company or startup.
       -Success stories (junior testimonials, startup growth stories).

3. Networking & Collaboration
       -Alumni’s professional role, current company/startup, and industry.
       -List of collaborations with institution or fellow alumni (e.g., co-organized an event, funded a lab, started a venture with alumni network).
       -Verified contact options (LinkedIn, professional email, or in-platform chat).

4. Recognition & Badges
      -Digital badges/achievements like:
             *Mentor Badge (mentored 10+ students).
             *Startup Founder Badge.
             *Contributor Badge (donated to 3+ events).
      -Leaderboard of top contributing alumni (motivates healthy competition).

=> Benefits / Impact
1.For Alumni:-
      -Builds personal brand and credibility among peers, students, and recruiters.
      -Increases visibility for collaborations with startups, corporates, and organizations.
      -Recognition for their contributions (not just money, but also mentorship & time).

2.For Students:-
      -Easy to find mentors and internship providers.
      -Can look up alumni role models and get inspired.

3.For Institutions:-

       -Strengthens alumni relations with data-driven transparency.
       -Encourages alumni to actively engage and contribute more.
       -Useful for fundraising pitches (“Look at how alumni contributions directly impact students!”).

4.For Recruiters & Startups:-
       -Can quickly identify engaged, credible, and socially responsible alumni for collaboration.
       -Alumni with active “status” become trusted partners for industry connections.
